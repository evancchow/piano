- for converting .aiff to .wav, use sox.
    $ sox foo.aiff bar.wav

- play .wav files with audacious.
    $ audacious foobar.wav

- ./piano/* filenames:
    Piano.[dynamic in 'pp','mf','ff'].[note, for example 'C4' or 'Gb2'].wav

- Make sure you have an outro (blank silence at the end)! Otherwise your song will get cut off.

- Looks like the notes aren't perfectly on beat. Okay for human touch but problematic here. This is probably b/c not each .wav file has the note begin immediately - some delays in how you press the note.
